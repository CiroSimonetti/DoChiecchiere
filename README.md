## Intro

 This (tisto) is a opensource, cross-platform (sie),  centralized (quisto poesse), instant messaging (IM) service owned by Noaltre.<br>

  DoChiecchiere client application runs on mobile devices but is also accessible from desktop computers (t'ho ditto che ancora ce stemo a lavorè), as long as the user's mobile device remains connected to the Internet while they use the desktop app. The service requires a cellular mobile telephone number to sign up.
